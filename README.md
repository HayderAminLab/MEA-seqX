# **MEA-seqX: High‐resolution Profiling of Large‐scale Electrophysiological and Transcriptional Network Dynamics**

![Figure 1](https://github.com/HayderAminLab/MEA-seqX/assets/158823360/15b48459-642f-4311-837e-eb733005b5ba)

The platform integrates high-density microelectrode arrays, spatial transcriptomics, optical imaging, and advanced computational strategies for simultaneous recording and analysis of molecular and electrical network activities at the individual cell level. 

It enables the study of nested dynamics between transcription and function, revealing coordinated spatiotemporal dynamics in brain circuitry at both molecular and functional levels. 
This platform also allows for the identification of different cell types based on their distinct bimodal profiles and uses machine learning algorithms to predict network-wide electrophysiological features from spatial gene expression.

## **Getting Started**

  - Download SRT and nEphys data from Zenodo and separate into subfolders based on condition i.e. SD and ENR. Include data from both the repository and downloaded datasets.
  - If using personal data, format folder structure as instructed for the provided data. 
  - Clone the respository locally.
       > git clone https://github.com/HayderAminLab/MEA-seqX.git
  - Go to the directory and work through the codes in the following order:
    1. Multiscale Spatial Alignment
    2. SRT Gene Expression 
    3. SRT_nEphys Network Activity Features
    4. XGBoost Algorithm Prediction
    5. SRT_nEphys Network Topological Metrics
    6. Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
   NOTE: For multi-step functions follow the order specified in the code.
