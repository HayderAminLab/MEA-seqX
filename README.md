The platform integrates high-density microelectrode arrays, spatial transcriptomics, optical imaging, and advanced computational strategies for simultaneous recording and analysis of molecular and electrical network activities at the individual cell level. 

It enables the study of nested dynamics between transcription and function, revealing coordinated spatiotemporal dynamics in brain circuitry at both molecular and functional levels. 
This platform also allows for the identification of different cell types based on their distinct bimodal profiles and uses machine learning algorithms to predict network-wide electrophysiological features from spatial gene expression.
